# CellularAutomata
 
Cellular Automata: a discrete model of computation studied in automata theory. Cellular automata are also called cellular spaces, tessellation automata, homogeneous structures, cellular structures, tessellation structures, and iterative arrays. Cellular automata have found application in various areas, including physics, theoretical biology and microstructure modeling. (*via. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)*)

The app is built off the idea of [Conways Game of Life.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) 

The base of the game is built using Pygame. Install Via.
```
pip install pygame
```










This program is still a work in progress, and if you have any recommendations let me know :)
